#### 05/23/2016 - 06/24/2016

## Course Description (Epicodus Learn How To Program Website)

* Week 1: Git, HTML and CSS
* Week 2: JavaScript and jQuery
* Week 3: Arrays & Looping
* Week 4: Object-oriented JavaScript
* Week 5: Group Project

## Successes
* LOVED the CSS and design parts of the course
* Spent a lot of time meticulously designing my independent projects, so improved a lot in design work
* Great at writing clean code & keeping everything organized
* Included a lot of comments in the HTML & CSS files
* Always typed code by hand - very rarely copied & pasted
* Focused on typing code off the top of my head and disliked referencing code from previous projects
* Largely grew to rely on my (and pair's) problem-solving skills to fix errors & spent longer time trying to fix things myself; rarely had to ask teachers for help (big improvement from when I used to ask after only 5 min of frustration!)
* Never spent too long on a problem though
* Wasn't afraid of mistakes or creating error-ridden code; it's all part of the process

## Struggles
* Dry code - had a LOT of repetitive lines
* Looping - for loops & forEach loops
* Kept getting mixed up between methods for arrays & methods for strings
* Trouble using empty arrays to gather data (sort of understood it when I restructured my Pizza-Order web app)
* Object-driven JavaScript - really struggled with understanding purpose of constructors/objects
* Not knowledgeable about the theory behind the code, usually just typed it up because that's what the lesson said to do. I knew the code worked but rarely questioned why it worked
* Didn't practice on the weekends
* Focused most of my energy & time on learning CSS, less on JavaScript
* Rarely networked/talked to classmates

## Effort Applied
* Spent 2-4 hours, 3-5 days/week directly after class working on CSS and styling my webpages
* Spent 3-5 hours revising my code reviews for resubmission
* Always had my code reviews on Mondays
* Always finished my code review resubmissions one day before it was due (usually a horrible procrastinator!)
* Started styling and formatting my independent projects on Thursday nights so as to focus on the JavaScript code all day Fridays (did this for the last 2 projects, as the previous 2 were light on JavaScript)
* Was absent one day this course (Monday)
* Never late to arrive or early to leave
* Essentially spent all my time studying/practicing during the weekdays: barely studied on the weekends, occasionally didn't complete homework until the next morning

## Next Steps/Things I Would Like to Pursue/Things to Improve On
* Add more comments in the scripts files (already include enough in HTML & CSS)
* Practice writing dry code & make everything less repetitive
* Try to complete the Epicodus Design course by myself - Goal: complete the course before internship starts in October 2016
* Build an object-driven MASH web game on my own using JavaScript
* Continue adding to Portfolio webpage based on new techniques learned in future classes
* Watch more Treehouse videos (especially for the general theories behind programming/software development because I don't know anything): find out what an API is
* Find and browse through programming magazines/websites/blogs
* Figure out how to  combine my interest in front-end development & interest in back-end development
* Also interested in Java & Android app development (C# is supposed to be similar to Java)
* Network with classmates

* Write notes at the end of every week during the C# course
* Practice C# on the weekends throughout the course & don't leave homework until weekday mornings!!
