## Course Description

This course is for absolute beginners to learn the fundamentals of programming. After completing this course, you'll be able to build basic webpages and understand programming fundamentals. No coding experience is required, but computer proficiency is necessary.

Here's some of what we'll cover:
* Command line: the tool programmers use to interact with their computers
* Git: the tool programmers use to track their code
* Markdown: a simple language for documents
* HTML and CSS: the presentation and styling languages of the web
* Bootstrap: a framework for easily creating good-looking websites
* jQuery: a JavaScript library for making interactive web pages
* JavaScript: the programming language of the web

## Successes
*

## Struggles
*

## Effort Applied
* Spent 2-4 hours, 3-5 days/week directly after class working on CSS and styling my webpages
* Spent 3-5 hours revising my code reviews for resubmission
* Always had my code reviews on Mondays
* Typically finished my code review resubmission one day before it was due
* Started styling and formatting my independent projects Thursday night so as to focus on the JavaScript code all day Friday (did this for the last 2 projects)
* Was absent one day this course (Monday)
* Never late to arrive or early to leave
* Essentially spent all my time studying/practicing during the weekdays: barely studied on the weekends, occasionally didn't complete the weekend homework until Monday morning
* Focused most of my energy & time on learning CSS, less on JavaScript

## Next Steps/Things I Would Like to Pursue
* Try to complete the Epicodus Design course by myself - Goal: complete the course before internship starts in October 2016
* Restructure web games created in Intro class using more objects in JavaScript
* Continue adding to Portfolio webpage based on new techniques learned in future classes
* Build an object-driven MASH web game on my own using JavaScript
* Watch more Treehouse videos (especially for the general theories behind programming/software development because I don't know anything): find out what an API is
* Find and browse through  programming magazines/info websites

* Write notes at the end of every week during the C# course
* Practice C# on the weekends throughout the course & don't leave homework until weekday mornings!!
