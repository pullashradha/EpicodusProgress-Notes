#### 06/27/2016 - 00/00/2016

#### By Shradha Pulla

## Course Description (Epicodus Website)

"This course builds on the programming fundamentals from Introduction to Programming and gives students more difficult problems to solve, a more advanced set of tools to solve them with, and establishes the foundations for learning the real-world technologies used by programmers on the job.

* Week 1: Behavior-driven development
* Week 2: Object-oriented design basics
* Week 3: Database basics with SQL
* Week 4: Databases continued (advanced)
* Week 5: Group projects

C# and .NET are typically used by larger enterprises, government agencies, and companies serving enterprise and government clients."

## Successes
* Week 1:
  * C# has much more straight-forward syntax than I expected (especially with constructors)
  * I can type up the code from scratch (excluding project.json and Startup.cs)
  * Starting to understand the reasons for Ids, and RESTful path route naming conventions
  * I can follow the lectures with minimal errors & problem-solve those minimal errors on my own
* Week 2:
  * Aced the 1st code review & didn't have to resubmit!
* Week 3:
  * Can create & manipulate databases in SSMS with ease
  * Slowly started to understand the meaning behind the code & syntax while working on the code review
* Week 4:
  * Can finally type up methods for CRUD functionality & JOIN statements without references
  * Starting to understand more about syntax & why it's need in specific places

## Struggles
* Week 1:
  * Can't understand the theoretical concepts behind static properties, complex objects and some other code mainly in how to show the pages in HomeModule
  * Difficult to come up with ways to tackle a problem as I'm not familiar with the software at all yet
* Week 2:
  * Structuring the tests was difficult, didn't realize that all of them had to consistently pass
  * Writing specs to meet the tests was confusing
* Week 3:
  * Understanding the meaning behind the code, and what the syntax specifically meant
  * Writing specs to help establish tests
  * Lot of content this week
* Week 4:
  * Partners drove most of the problem-solving & new ideas
  * Need to practice how to come up with new methods/complex programs

## Effort Applied
* Week 1:
  * Finished most of the homework the night before instead of the morning of that lesson
  * No work done outside of class time during the weekdays
* Week 2:
  * Missed class on Tuesday, so only had 2 days of peer-coding + code review (short week due to 4th of July)
  * Didn't stay after class to practice
  * Didn't practice csharp during the weekend
  * Practiced a little bit of CSS from the Epicodus class exercises during the weekend
* Week 3:
  * Partners did most of the work this week- I typed enough, but didn't think of how to construct the code
  * Didn't stay after class to practice
  * Didn't complete code review resubmission until the weekend
  * Didn't practice during the weekend
* Week 4:
  * Typed a lot, typed almost everything I had to do
  * Very rarely referenced my old notes when typing new code
  * Stayed after class 2 days this week to improve projects
  * Watched C# lectures from https://www.pluralsight.com/ & https://www.toptal.com/ during the weekend, and practiced by completing an exercise from the class work

## Next Steps/Things I Would Like to Pursue/Things to Improve On
* Try LINQPad.Net to bypass compiling the file every time code is changed in an Objects file
* Go to a .Net dev or CSharp dev meeting/meetup/company event
* Learn how to write proper specs, especially for tests
* Study theory behind databases & CRUD code
