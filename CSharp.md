## Course Description (Epicodus Website)

"This course builds on the programming fundamentals from Introduction to Programming and gives students more difficult problems to solve, a more advanced set of tools to solve them with, and establishes the foundations for learning the real-world technologies used by programmers on the job.

* Week 1: Behavior-driven development
* Week 2: Object-oriented design basics
* Week 3: Database basics with SQL
* Week 4: Databases continued
* Week 5: Group projects

C# and .NET are typically used by larger enterprises, government agencies, and companies serving enterprise and government clients."

## Successes
* Week 1:
  * C# has much more straight-forward syntax than I expected (especially with constructors)
  * I can type up the code from scratch (excluding project.json and Startup.cs)
  * Starting to understand the reasons for Ids, and RESTful path route naming conventions
  * I can follow the lectures with minimal errors & problem-solve those minimal errors on my own

## Struggles
* Week 1:
  * Can't understand the theoretical concepts behind static properties, complex objects and some other code mainly in how to show the pages in HomeModule
  * Difficult to come up with ways to tackle a problem as I'm not familiar with the software at all yet

## Effort Applied
* Week 1:
  * Finished most of the homework the night before instead of the morning of that lesson
  * No work done outside of class time during the weekdays
  * Watched C# lectures from https://www.pluralsight.com/ & https://www.toptal.com/ during the weekend, and practiced coding

## Next Steps/Things I Would Like to Pursue/Things to Improve On
* Try LINQPad.Net to bypass compiling the file every time code is changed in an Objects file
